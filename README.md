# Ai-project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The main focus of my solution is to optimize the utilization of the operating theater. Separation of the predicitable operations from the outliers will provide a better outset 
for the daily planning, manning and execution of the programme.

## Background

Operations are canceled on a daily basis because other procedures takes longer than anticipated. This leads to poor utilization, low patientsatisfaction, low employee 
satisfaction, risk of escalation in sickness etc. 

## How is it used?

The solution will be used by the hospital planning staff in their planning/booking of operations. Should be based on realtime data and draw data from the patient asdministration 
systems. Will display estimated lenght of operation and the precision of the estimate.

## Data sources and AI methods

Historic data for buildning and testing the model will come from the patient asdministration system
Expected that the estimation wil be some form of regression. 

## What next?

The project will in its first iterations be based on hip and knee operations. Next phase will be to expand it to other tyoes of operations.
